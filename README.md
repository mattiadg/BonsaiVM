# BonsaiVM

BonsaiVM is an educational project born out of the fun of writing a small but functional virtual machine. Such VM is not tailored for a single language, and I plan to build some compilers for small languages that target it.

This project is released with a permissive license to allow anybody to read and freely experiment with its source code. It is designed for studying, and it can be useful for students and anybody interested in the subject. 

It is strongly inspired by the VM of the [Monkey](https://interpreterbook.com/) language.

This is a personal project and, as such, it does not accept code contributions.
